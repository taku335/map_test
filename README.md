# Map Test

Displays an interactive map, plots stops from a GTFS dataset, and draws each
bus route using the shape geometry provided by the feed.

## Getting Started

1. Open `index.html` in your browser. The application automatically fetches the
   latest Kariya City community bus GTFS data from [GTFS Data.jp](https://gtfs-data.jp)
   and displays the stops on the map.
