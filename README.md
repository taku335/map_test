# Map Test

Displays an interactive map and plots stops from a GTFS dataset. The stops are
also connected in sequence based on the timetable data to visualize the bus
routes.

## Getting Started

1. Open `index.html` in your browser. The application automatically fetches the
   latest Kariya City community bus GTFS data from [GTFS Data.jp](https://gtfs-data.jp)
   and displays the stops on the map.
