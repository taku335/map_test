# Map Test

This project demonstrates a simple Vue.js page that displays Google Maps and allows route searches between a starting point and destination.

## Getting Started

1. Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` in `index.html` with your Google Maps JavaScript API key.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser or host the repository with GitHub Pages.

## Usage

Enter a departure point and destination, optionally choose a date and time, then click **検索** to see the route displayed on the map.
